                                and upcoming poets and shayars. Kavi Sammelan literally means a
                                gathering of poets. The traditional format of a kavisammelan has a
                                Sanchalak (anchor) and a few poets. The number of total poets vary from
                                three to twenties and even thirty. In the traditional format, all the poetssit
                                on a mattress on the stage. There is one standing mike, and one sitting mike.
                                The sitting mike is kept in front of the Sanchalak. He introducesthe whole
                                team to the audiences, and then callsthe poets one by one. These poets
                                come to the standing mike and recite their poemsto the audiences. The
                                order of recitation is generally from most junior to the mostsenior poet.
                                Most of the traditional kavisammelan have 7–12 poets.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                     It is a group event in which the team needs to paint on a single canvas without using brushes.
